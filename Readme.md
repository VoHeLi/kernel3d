# VoHeLi's Android 3D XR Kernel

A personal research project about running multiple Android 2D Apps, and multiple OpenXR Apps (even for different hardware) on the Lynx R1.
The code is very messy, and it would need a whole refactoring to be optimized and more readable.
However, I made it open source, so that, people can see the work done and test it with their apps, but I didn't write full documentation for now.
